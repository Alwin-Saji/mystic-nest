# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
- ✅ Build works locally (`npm run build:github`)
- ✅ Base path is correct (`/mystic-nest/`)
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow is configured
- ✅ Code has been pushed to GitHub

## Manual Deployment Steps

If GitHub Actions is not working, you can manually deploy:

### Option 1: Manual GitHub Pages Setup

1. **Go to your repository settings:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/Alwin-Saji/mystic-nest/settings/pages

2. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/docs` (we'll create this)

3. **Create docs folder with built files:**
   ```bash
   # Build the project
   npm run build:github
   
   # Create docs folder and copy build output
   mkdir docs
   cp -r dist/* docs/
   git add docs/
   git commit -m "Add docs folder for GitHub Pages"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Check GitHub Actions

1. **Go to Actions tab:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/Alwin-Saji/mystic-nest/actions

2. **Check if workflow is running:**
   - Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - If it's not running, click "Run workflow"

3. **Check workflow logs:**
   - Click on the workflow run
   - Look for any error messages

### Option 3: Alternative Deployment (Netlify)

1. **Go to Netlify:**
   - Visit: https://netlify.com
   - Click "New site from Git"

2. **Connect your repository:**
   - Repository: `Alwin-Saji/mystic-nest`
   - Build command: `npm run build:github`
   - Publish directory: `dist`

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Page not found" (404)
- **Solution:** Check that base path is `/mystic-nest/` in vite.config.github.ts

### Issue: Assets not loading
- **Solution:** Verify the build output in `dist/` folder has correct paths

### Issue: GitHub Actions not running
- **Solution:** Check repository settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions

### Issue: Build fails in GitHub Actions
- **Solution:** Check the Actions tab for error logs

## Quick Test

To test if everything is working:

1. **Build locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:github
   ```

2. **Serve locally to test:**
   ```bash
   npx serve dist
   ```

3. **Check the built files:**
   - Open `dist/index.html` in browser
   - Should show your app working

## Next Steps

1. Check GitHub Actions: https://github.com/Alwin-Saji/mystic-nest/actions
2. Check GitHub Pages settings: https://github.com/Alwin-Saji/mystic-nest/settings/pages
